<!--
Welcome! Today we're going to talk about React. I have a short intro lesson for you, and then we'll dive right into some code.
If you touch any frontend code at EquipmentShare, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll be written in React
I tend to get very excited and speak a little too quickly, so please let me know if you need me to slow down or repeat anything.

# What is React.js?

Tell me about your experience with React so far

# React is...

- üß© A open source JavaScript library built by Meta
- üìù According to the [React docs](https://react.dev/), it is a ‚Äúdeclarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces." It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called 'components'
- üë©‚Äçüíª One of the most popular ways to build modern web applications (over 9 million weekly downloads from npm!)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Super fast, flexible, and scalable
- üéÇ 10 years old as of May 2023
- ü•≥ An absolute joy!

- React components are often compared to building with legos-using many self-contained discrete parts to make up a whole. I think that maybe Matryoshka dolls are a better analogy, because components can be nested inside each other, and they can be reused in different places. But maybe the best visual analogy would be a set of Matryoshka dolls made out of legos.
- As probably the most popular way to build web applications these days, React is an incredibly wide-ranging library. There are many, many approaches to writing react code and about a zillion tools and compatible packages and libraries to explore
- That said, today‚Äôs lesson will be a pretty brief introduction to get you started writing and updating components. If you‚Äôve already work with React, this may be a bit of a refresher for you

# The Virtual DOM
React was developed to solve a problem: how to efficiently update the Document Object Model (DOM).

In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding ‚Äúvirtual DOM object.‚Äù A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing‚Äôs power to directly change what‚Äôs on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house[^1]

# JSX

React uses a syntax extension called JSX that looks like a combination of HTML and JavaScript. 

```ts
const h1 = <h1>Hello, interns!</h1>
```
It gets compiled into regular JavaScript in the browser
JSX elements are treated like regular old JavaScript expressions, which means they can be saved as a variable, stored in object or array, or passed to a function.

Just like HTML elements, JSX elements can have attributes, like this: 
```ts
const h1 = <h1 id=‚Äùintern-title‚Äù>Hello, interns!</h1>
```
A fun little gotcha with JSX is that all elements in a component must be within the same parent element. If they don't all naturally go within the same parent, you can use a fragment, which can be expressed as an empty tag, like this:
```ts
<>
	<h1>Hello, friends!</h1>
	<p>We are child elements that need to be wrapped in a parent!</p>
</>
```

# Class Components versus Functional Components
A React component can be written as either a JavaScript class or a function. Functional components are more popular these days, since they can leverage newer feature like React hooks. However, you may encounter class components in older code.

Here's a class component:
```ts {all|1|2|3|all}
export class WelcomeHeading extends React.Component {
   render() {
       return (
           <h1>Hello, friends!</h1>
       )}
}

```
And here's the same thing as a functional component:
```ts {all|1|2|all}
export const WelcomeHeading = ( ) => {
   return (
       <h1>Hello, friends!</h1>
   )
}

```
